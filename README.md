## Shell script for adding log entry in 100 Days of code Journal

* Clone the repo
* In the shell script replace my directory path with yours
* Log daily with ease

# Usage example

* If run with no arguments it will just make an entry in the log file.
* pass -c to make a commit
* pass -p to push

Pull Requests are welcome. This is my first script so a lot of improvements are needed and any help would be appreciated.
